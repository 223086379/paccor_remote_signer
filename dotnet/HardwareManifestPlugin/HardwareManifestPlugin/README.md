paccor is a popular solution for creating the TCG Platform Certificate. The platform certificate enables traceability in the hardware supply chain of a computing device.


This HardwareManifestPlugin is an experimental feature that can be used to extend the [HIRS .NET Provisioner](https://github.com/nsacyber/hirs/). The IHardwareManifest interface, within this package, defines the parameters necessary to customize hardware evidence collection by the Provisioner client.


See the paccor.paccor_scripts nuget package for an example implementation.
