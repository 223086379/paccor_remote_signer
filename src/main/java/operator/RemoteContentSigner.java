/**
 * The `RestContentSigner` class is compatible with Bouncy Castle's `ContentSigner` interface because 
 * it implements all the required methods of the `ContentSigner` interface. Here's how each method contributes to the compatibility:

1. `getAlgorithmIdentifier()`: This method is used by Bouncy Castle to identify the algorithm used for signing.
     In the `RestContentSigner` class, this method should return an `AlgorithmIdentifier` that corresponds to the 
     algorithm used by the remote signing service. This ensures that Bouncy Castle can correctly interpret the signature 
     produced by the remote service.

2. `getOutputStream()`: This method is used by Bouncy Castle to provide the data that needs to be signed. In the 
    `RestContentSigner` class, this method should return an `OutputStream` that collects the data to be signed. 
    This data is then sent to the remote signing service in the `getSignature()` method.

3. `getSignature()`: This method is used by Bouncy Castle to obtain the signature of the data provided through the 
    `OutputStream`. In the `RestContentSigner` class, this method should send the collected data to the remote signing 
     service and return the signature produced by the service. This ensures that Bouncy Castle can use the signature in 
     the generation of certificates or other signed objects.

    By implementing these methods in the way described, the `RestContentSigner` class can be used as a `ContentSigner` in 
    any Bouncy Castle operation that requires a `ContentSigner`. This includes the generation of certificates, as shown in 
    the provided Bouncy Castle code.
